# The Manual Page

Inspired by my newfound interest in manual transmission cars, I created a simple web app where users can enter a year and see all makes/models sold in the United States with a manual transmission.

Data for the app was sourced from the U.S. Department of Energy's fuel economy records, which can be found at <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.fueleconomy.gov</a>

The web app was implemented using:

🐍 **Flask** backend to return car data in JSON

🐼 **Pandas** for data processing

🏞️ **Vue.js** for the frontend interface
