# The Manual Page

Inspired by my interest in manual transmission cars, I built a web app that lets users explore all makes and models sold in the U.S. with a manual transmission by year.

Data for the app was sourced from the U.S. Department of Energy's fuel economy records, which can be found at [fueleconomy.gov](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/)

The web app was implemented using:

🐍 **Flask** backend to return car data in JSON

🐼 **Pandas** for data processing

🏞️ **Vue.js** for the frontend interface

📊 **SQLite** and SQLAlchemy for database management
